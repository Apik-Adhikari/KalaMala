      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        KALAMALA is a curated marketplace celebrating handmade craftsmanship and small-batch artistry.
        We bring together independent makers from across regions to showcase thoughtfully created products —
        from jewelry and textiles to ceramics and home goods. Our goal is to make it easy for shoppers to
        discover meaningful, well-crafted items while supporting the talented people who make them.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        We believe in stories behind every object. Each product on KALAMALA is selected for its quality,
        sustainability, and the care with which it was created. We prioritize transparent sourcing, fair
        pricing for makers, and timeless designs that can be cherished for years.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Whether you're shopping for a thoughtful gift or something unique for your home, KALAMALA aims to
        connect you with makers and their stories. If you're a maker and would like to join our community,
        reach out — we'd love to hear about your craft.
      </p>

      <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">Thank you for supporting small makers and choosing thoughtful goods.</p>
